# Patient Management System

This is a C++ console application for managing users and patients.  
The program allows users to sign up, log in, and then manage patient records, including adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting patients.  

It uses binary files (`users.dat` and `patients.dat`) to store user credentials and patient data.  
The program is menu-driven, providing a simple interface to navigate between login, patient management, and system exit.
